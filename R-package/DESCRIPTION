Title: Conditional Distance Correlation Based Feature Screening and Conditional Independence Inference
Description: Conditional distance correlation <doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.993081> is a novel conditional dependence measurement of two multivariate random variables given a confounding variable. This package provides conditional distance correlation, performs the conditional distance correlation sure independence screening procedure for ultrahigh dimensional data <https://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/J28N1/J28N114/J28N114.html>, and conducts conditional distance covariance test for conditional independence assumption of two multivariate variable.
